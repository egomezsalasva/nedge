      <p>
        Your support means a lot to Nedge. It helps the platform stay active and
        it&apos;s growth. There is a lot of work that goes into making Nedge a
        reality. From keeping the platform itself running smoothly and
        improving, to finding a list of curated stylists to feature on the
        platform, to negotiating with brands to provide us with affiliate link
        so both Nedge and the stylists can profit and provide you with
        inspiration and discover garments from both up and coming brands as well
        as established brands.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>So, to all our supporters, thank you for your support.</b>
