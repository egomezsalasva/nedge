      <p>
        Your support means a lot to Nedge. It helps the platform stay active and
        grow. A lot of work goes into making Nedge a reality. From keeping the
        platform running smoothly, to curating a list of stylists to feature on
        the platform and negotiating with brands to establish affiliate links so
        both Nedge and the stylists can profit and provide you with
        inspirational garments from both up and coming brands as well as
        established brands.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>So, to all our supporters, thank you from Nedge.</b>
